	<h3>Boreala</h3>
        <img src="/flags/boreala-flag.svg" alt="boreala" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>Boreála is a declining industrial power whose glory days have long since faded into history. It once ruled large swaths of territory abutting the Inland Sea and beyond, from eastern Taiga through the Lowland League, and incorporating all of coastal Riparia. Its decline was heralded by an ill-fated attempt to expand its holdings to include the deeply religious, but militarily quite skillful, peoples of the Highlands. That failed war set off a chain reaction that led to imperial collapse and the loss of ⅔ of Boreálan territory. The advancing armies of Archipelagia were stopped only by Boreála’s test detonation of an atomic bomb in the Northern Barrier Range. While the rest of Oceania refers to this conflict as “The Inland Sea Wars,” Boreálan schoolchildren learn of this historical period as simply, “The Catastrophe.” Boreála is one of only two states (the other being its arch-rival, Archipelagia) to possess nuclear weapons and a permanent veto-wielding seat on the UNO Security Council.</h4>

	<h3>Arborea</h3>
        <img src="/flags/arborea-flag.svg" alt="arborea" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>Arborea is a poor but rapidly developing democracy. The state’s origins lie to the south, in the numerous coastal villages on the shores of the Austral Sea. As Arborea’s population surged in the last century, it expanded up the Arterial River to the north and east, bringing increasing conflict with the ethnically distinct Riparians in the Boreálan Empire. When the Empire faced first civil and then international war, Arborea at first declared its neutrality in the dispute. Arborea only declared war on Boreála when the tide was already turning against the aging empire. At the Laulima Peace Conference that ended the Wars, Archipelagia and the newly independent Lowland League rewarded Arborea with a significant portion of formerly Boreálan lands, including most of the land abutting the Arterial River up to and including the northern enclaves of Riparia City (now renamed Prasina). These new territories have proven an especially lucrative asset, as the riverine ecosystem’s incredible biological diversity fuels economic development based on biogenetic research. Arborea’s developing economy has a bright future, if the state can manage to balance its desire for intellectual property protections with a thirst for foreign direct investment from multinational corporations.</h4>

        <h3>Desicca</h3>
        <img src="/flags/desicca-flag.svg" alt="desicca" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>Desicca is governed by an ancient monarchy (or so its rulers claim) that has for decades ignored calls for democratic reforms. Rich in petroleum resources, the regime has maintained its legitimacy through targeted patronage and force of arms—all funded by the sale of oil on the international market. The government has in recent decades buttressed its legitimacy by supporting what was once an obscure offshoot of the Highlanders’ mountain-born religion. That offshoot, Alberghinism (named for the region of its provenance), claims that Dessica is the spiritual wellspring for all of Oceania. Nestled in the foothills of the Southern Barrier Range, the priests of Alberghia claim that the mountain range feeds the Arterial River that waters Oceania’s forests and farms, just as Dessica’s oil fields power Oceania’s industry. This religious doctrine has been extremely useful to the government as a source of legitimacy, but it has come at the cost of poor relations with the League, which not surprisingly resents Dessican religious leaders’ increasingly bellicose calls for incorporation of the entire Southern Barrier Range into Dessica.</h4>

        <h3>Taiga</h3>
        <img src="/flags/taiga-flag.svg" alt="taiga" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>Taiga is a progressive social democracy clawed out of the frigid northern regions of western Oceania. Taiga’s small, well-educated population powers a technologically advanced, knowledge-based economy. This soft-power superpower inspires other peoples with its proud history of gender equality, an inclusive redistributive economic model, and a centuries-old constitution that safeguards the rights of its people. Taigans are skeptical of military escapades, but are unabashed critics of other states’ human rights violations. Indeed, Taiga’s second-largest city, Port Kelvin, hosts the Oceanic Rights Commission; it was at Taiga’s initiative that the ORC’s mandate was recently expanded to allow for investigation and prosecution of human rights violations.</h4>

	<br><br>
	<h3>Lowland League</h3>
        <img src="/flags/league-flag.svg" alt="league" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>The Lowland League of Free Republics is a confederation of seafaring states whose economy has long outstripped those of its immediate neighbors. Its one economic peer is Archipelagia, a state with which it shares a long and friendly history ever since Archipelagia supported the League's bid for independence from Boreála. Surrounded by non-democratic states, the League has fought several border skirmishes to defend its territory from more predatory regimes. These have included disputes with Desicca, which claims the Southern Barrier Range for “religious” reasons; with Boreála over the strategic land bridge linking north and south (and which also includes the Great Canal, an important shipping lane linking the Inland Sea with the Eastern Sea); and most worrisome for the League, an ethnic dispute with Riparia, whose government claims to represent ethnic Riparians living in the southwestern provinces of the League. The League bases much of its foreign policy on a strong defensive alliance with its long-time partner, Archipelagia.</h4>

	<br>
        <h3>Archipelagia</h3>
        <img src="/flags/variant-archipelaga-flag.svg" alt="archipelagia" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>Archipelagia was the first of Oceania's states to industrialize and remains one of its shining economic stars. This great seafaring democracy has been accused of imperialistic behavior because of its long-stated policy of supporting democratic reform in other states. Indeed, were it not for Archipelagia's military aid for Lowland League revolutionaries, it is entirely possible the League would still be ruled by Boreála. Where Taiga shies away from military intervention, the Archipelagian leadership often claims a responsibility to protect civilians in times of humanitarian crisis—even when those crises are the result of other governments’ actions or inactions. Archipelagia is one of Oceania’s only two nuclear powers (the other being Boreála), and it holds a veto-wielding seat on the UNO Security Council, headquartered in the Archipelagian city of Laulima.</h4>

        <h3>Highlands</h3>
        <img src="/flags/highlands-flag.svg" alt="highlands" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>The Highlands is a hermit kingdom historically isolated from the petty wars and intrigues of the rest of Oceania. This extremely mountainous country has long been considered "unconquerable" by foreign powers. It was generally considered to be outside Oceania’s great power political system until it was invaded and temporarily occupied by Boreála. It was this occupation—and the Highlanders’ resistance—that was the catalyst for the eventual collapse of the Boreálan Empire. Since the withdrawal of Boreálan troops at the end of the war, the Highlands have returned to their previous status as a somewhat closed and deeply religious state. The government has generally resisted Taigan calls for democratic reform, instead arguing that Highlander society is based on elevating the community over the individual. The Highlanders’ isolation has not prevented cultural exchange, however, with the Highlands’ mountain-born religion extending to much of Desicca and across the Narrow Sea into parts of western Taiga. Relations with Boreála, meanwhile, remain tense; Highlanders continue to seek reparations for the damage done to their country during the occupation.</h4>

        <h3>Riparia</h3>
        <img src="/flags/riperia-flag.svg" alt="riparia" height="200" width="300" align=left><img/>
	<h4>Riparia is today a fiercely independent state ruled by a military junta credited with restoring order after Boreála’s imperial collapse a generation ago. Riparia was once Oceania’s most advanced civilization…approximately a millennium ago. Indeed, archeologists trace the origins of Oceanian culture to the fertile riverbed in which Riparia City now stands. This proud culture was overrun by Boreálan invaders as that northern empire extended its holdings around the Inland Sea. Riparia found itself a province within a greater empire, its once great civilization reduced to museum exhibits throughout the empire. The Treaty of Laulima that ended the Inland Sea Wars added to this national trauma by rewarding significant parcels of historically Riparian land to Archipelagia’s allies, the League and Arborea. Riparia’s military leadership bases its legitimacy on wresting independence from Boreála at the close of the war. The junta buttresses this with fierce nationalistic rhetoric, claiming a mandate for reuniting all ethnic Riparians under its banner and for regaining all of Riparia’s ancient land holdings.</h4>
